You need to install MOA-SPSS libraries for validating XADES signatures

Download MOA-ID from this address
https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/moa-idspss/asset_release/moa-id-221

(Test was performed with version 2.2.1)

From the unpacked MOA-ID directory copy the moa-spss-lib-x.x.x subdirectory here

Finally, the symlink moa-spss-lib must point to the downlaoded library - check it.
